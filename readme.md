# Order of most work
  Out of everything here I have the most experience with C++, then java, then python. C++ has the most projects, followed by java, followed by python.
  I also do have another repo with personal projects so be sure to check that out @ https://github.com/Jay-271/Disc_bot_1.0
  -> This was my first git commit stuff so its a bit off (this one is too but I hope its better to understand). 
# C++
  This is just a bunch of old stuff in C++ mostly, with a few expirments (one in python).
including here are old projects with only a few personal ones, others were in-class group activities. 
The TextArt was a multi-step project and the final one was the TextArtLL (linked list).
# Java
  This folder contains a bunch of notes in java with some small examples of how things work. Projects here are labeled as assignments...
# Python
  All just expirements!
