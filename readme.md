# C++
This is just a bunch of old stuff in C++ mostly, with a few expirments (one in python).
including here are old projects with only a few personal ones, others were in-class group activities. 
The TextArt was a multi-step project and the final one was the TextArtLL (linked list).
# Java
This folder contains a bunch of notes in java with some small examples of how things work. Projects here are labeled as assignments...
# Python
All just expirements!
